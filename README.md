Here I will share my way of AI based automating pcb desings and things that I create

Its not possible to draw schematic as we are used to but its possible to give datasheet and obtain netlist (like csv file), and use this netlist directly in PCB layout. In layout phases, although its possible to place the components and route them, its still not as perfect as professional layouters. Yet, its quite helpful to categorize similar components like LEDs, and place them in a neat way. 

Long story short, this project convert the traditional mouse click and draw technique to uploading datasheet, sharing what custom design is intended and have the completed netlist, together with schematic imaging.
